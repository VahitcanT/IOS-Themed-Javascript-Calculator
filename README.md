# IOS Themed Javascript Calcutor for Toros University CSE203

Explanation for files.

First when I coding. I was strict to be the same look as the original calculator from ios but some additional features need to be added because the project wants like that so I will add the project file to compare with what they wanted. 1.html is what I designed first then changed when I saw the pdf from our teacher, 1.html is not functional and css is same as 1.css.

ios-calculator.webp is for getting inspired from that picture when im coding it.
